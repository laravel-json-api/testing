# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [this changelog format](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [2.1.0] - 2023-02-18

### Added

- Add support for PHPUnit 10.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-02-14

### Changed

- Upgraded to Laravel 10 and set minimum PHP version to `8.1`.

## [1.1.2] - 2023-01-15

### Fixed

- The `TestBuilder::withData()` method no longer converts the provided data to a `Collection` if it implements
  the `JsonSerializable` interface. This change was required because Laravel changed how they converted objects to
  collections. It is not strictly necessary to convert objects that implement the JSON serializable interface, because
  they will be converted when the test JSON value is JSON encoded. Technically this is a breaking fix if
  the `TestBuilder` class has been extended. However, this change is being done as a bug fix because the bug was caused
  by a minor release of Laravel.

## [1.1.1] - 2022-02-27

### Fixed

- The Symfony response class can return `false` for the response content. This caused a fatal error when the content was
  passed to JSON:API assertions - as the assertion methods type-hint the content as a `string` in version 4 of that
  dependency. This has been fixed by adding a `TestResponse::getContent()` method that returns an empty string if the
  Symfony method returns `false`.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-02-08

### Added

- Package now supports Laravel 9.
- Added support for `cloudcreativity/json-api-testing` version 4.0.
- Values passed to the test builder `filter()` and `page` methods can now include `UrlRoutable` objects (i.e. models).
  Routable objects are converted to their route key value. This also applies when a filter or page value is set via the
  `query()` method.

### Deprecated

- The following page assertions will be removed in the next major release. You should use the fluent methods instead to
  assert the resources fetched, meta and links. Deprecated methods are:
    - `assertFetchedPage()` - use `assertFetchedMany()`, `assertMeta()` and `assertLinks()`.
    - `assertFetchedPageInOrder()` - use `assertFetchedManyInOrder()`, `assertMeta()` and `assertLinks()`.
    - `assertFetchedEmptyPage()` - use `assertFetchedNone()`, `assertMeta()` and `assertLinks()`.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-07-31

### Changed

- Updated `cloudcreativity/json-api-testing` dependency to `3.3.0`.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2021-03-30
